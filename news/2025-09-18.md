At approximately 3:30 pm on September 18, Mesa County Search & Rescue responded alongside Grand Junction Fire Department (GJFD) to assist a mountain biker who sustained knee and lower leg injuries near the area known as the “Toilet Bowl” on the Ribbon Trail.

Using ropes, natural anchors and a rescue litter, the injured individual was safely transported across steep, hazardous terrain to a landing zone, where they were transferred to CareFlight for further medical care.

We are grateful for the strong partnership with GJFD and CareFlight that allowed us to get this individual to advanced medical care quickly. We wish them a full and speedy recovery.

The Ribbon Trail is famous for its high-speed sandstone slabs and technical features. Always scout obstacles before you ride and remember that even experienced riders can run into trouble.
