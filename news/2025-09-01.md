On September 1 at 3:43 pm, Mesa County Search and Rescue (MCSAR) was placed on standby to assist Delta County Search and Rescue (DELSAR) after a hiker suffered a serious fall on Crags Crest Trail above Butts Lake. DELSAR quickly responded and requested additional support from the High Altitude Army National Guard Aviation Training Site (HAATS).

At 5:35 pm, after DELSAR made initial contact with the subject and evaluated the scene, MCSAR was requested to respond to provide personnel and equipment for a technical rescue. MCSAR team members, inserted into the field by CareFlight, made patient contact and began preparing for a technical rescue while additional members staged at Crags Crest Campground. A second CareFlight insertion was preparing to bring in supplementary gear and rescuers when HAATS arrived on scene and was able to complete a direct hoist evacuation at 7:45 pm.

Weâ€™re grateful for the excellent inter-agency coordination between Delta Search and Rescue, Delta EMS, CareFlight, Plateau Valley Fire, and HAATS. Each organization played a vital role in ensuring the patient received the fastest care possible.
