At approximately 12:40 PM on September 13, our team was requested to assist a subject north of Gateway along the Dolores River.

The individual had attempted to escape a flash flood on an ATV. When the ATV became disabled, they abandoned the vehicle and were able to exit the flood waters. The subject was safely contacted and retrieved by law enforcement.

The subject reported that three members of their hunting party were away from camp without supplies or medications and would likely need assistance.

Our SAR team deployed two UTVs and a truck to access the area. Team members hiked in to retrieve essential items from the camp, which were carried back to the UTVs and transported to the staging area.

All teams were safely demobilized at approximately 4:00 PM.
