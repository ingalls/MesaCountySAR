            "date": "2025-01-02",
            "body": "Around 9 a.m. on January 2, 2025, Mesa County Search and Rescue (MCSAR) received a call to rescue a trapped tracking dog near Collbran, CO. The owners of the dog, named Tiny, advised MCSAR that Tiny had been tracking a mountain lion when she became stranded in the middle of a cliff face near the mountain‚Äôs summit 24 hours prior. Thanks to a GPS tracker on Tiny‚Äôs collar, the owners knew her approximate location, though realized it wasn‚Äôt somewhere they could safely reach her.\n\nWith Tiny‚Äôs approximate location known, the MCSAR team planned their rescue operations using the Colorado Team Awareness Kit (COTAK) to safely rescue her from the mountainside. However, the team quickly encountered challenging terrain, which slowed progress significantly. After some consideration, the MCSAR operations team determined that splitting the group into two teams would be more effective in finding a route through the many cliff bands that had halted progress toward Tiny‚Äôs location. A hasty team of three members, deemed Team 1, was sent to the east to try to find a break in the cliffs, while the larger group, deemed Team 2, attempted to find a gap to the west.\n\nOver the next six hours, Team 1 carefully rappelled and climbed through the cliff bands, working toward the ridge top. They ascended several thousand feet from there before finally reaching the peak where Tiny had become trapped. After confirming Tiny‚Äôs location below, the team built a system to lower a rescuer down and retrieve her using a harness designed for dog rescue in technical terrain. At approximately 4 p.m., Tiny was raised back to the mountain's summit.\n\nThe celebration of Tiny's rescue from the cliff face was short-lived, however, as Team 1 had a new challenge: finding a safe route back to the mountain's base in diminishing light. Back at the base of the mountain, MCSAR operations team members were able to map out a different route in COTAK for Team 1 to follow. This new route took Team 1 across the other side of the mountain through snow-covered terrain, including multiple waterfalls that they rappelled off of with Tiny in tow. Due to Tiny‚Äôs diminished physical condition, Team 1 carried the dog for much of the trip.\n\nAs Team 1 descended the mountain, MCSAR moved their staging location to the north side to gain better access to Team 1. Once relocated, Team 2 made their way up the mountain on horses provided and led by Tiny‚Äôs owner. They brought essential supplies - water and food - to replenish Team 1. Once the two groups united, the MCSAR members swapped places, giving Team 1 a much-needed break as they rode the horses the rest of the way down the mountain.\n\nTiny was reunited with her very thankful owners around 10 p.m., marking the end of a successful rescue mission.\n\nEvery mission matters for Mesa County Search and Rescue, even if it‚Äôs Tiny.\n"

            "body": "At approximately 12:40 PM on September 13, our team was requested to assist a subject north of Gateway along the Dolores River.\n\nThe individual had attempted to escape a flash flood on an ATV. When the ATV became disabled, they abandoned the vehicle and were able to exit the flood waters. The subject was safely contacted and retrieved by law enforcement.\n\nThe subject reported that three members of their hunting party were away from camp without supplies or medications and would likely need assistance.\n\nOur SAR team deployed two UTVs and a truck to access the area. Team members hiked in to retrieve essential items from the camp, which were carried back to the UTVs and transported to the staging area.\n\nAll teams were safely demobilized at approximately 4:00 PM.\n\n‚ù§Ô∏èüíõ As a reminder, MCSAR is fully funded through our volunteers & community support, donations allow us to continue our mission.
